**Description:**
Analysis of Western Australia's High Schools rankings based on ATAR, NAPLAN, & ICSEA.
<br>

**Data Clean-up:** (Performed in Python) 
1.	Merging data from various datasets
2.	Check for duplication
3.	Check for invalid value
4.	Make sure the data frame is consistent for all the data set.
5.	Make sure no rows are accidentally deleted


**Summary:**
For much of human history, education has served an important purpose, ensuring we have the tools to survive. People need jobs to eat and to have jobs, they need to learn how to work.
Education has been an essential part of every society. Education shows us the importance of hard work and, at the same time, helps us grow and develop.
In this project, we analyse the rankings of High Schools in Western Australia based on 3 factors.
- Median ATAR scores of Year 12 students per school 
- NAPLAN scores of Year 9 students per school 
- ICSEA scores per school

There are 193 High Schools with 103,198 enrolled High Shool students included in our 2016-2020 dataset.
<br>


**Limitation and Challenges:**
- There is no single source of information or centralized dataset with regards to schools information.
- Yearly ATAR & NAPLAN scores per school are not publicly or readily available online. 
- Not all schools are present per year in our dataset (eg. unavailable data or school/s closing) 
- Some schools change their name which affects the comparison of the data. 
- School name varies per dataset (eg. format of school name)


## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

**Questions to Answer:** <br>
1.	Does the type of school (Government or Non-Government) have an impact on the quality of education?
2.	Will a high score in NAPLAN translate to a high score in ATAR?
